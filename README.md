avr_mppt_charge_controller
==========================

To build a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) charge controller for cheap.

This is no big deal, thousands of people around the world has already done this.
I started this to reuse components from few malfunctioning buck and boost converters I got from eBay.
Figured out that although control circuits of these failed, inductors, MOSFET s and Schottky diodes worked like almost new.
Than throwing them into garbage I thought of recycling them into my own intelligent charge controller.

This is my first time working with inductors. It was a trial and fail case with trying out different PWM frequencies with inductors.
Chose 32kHz as it gave me best efficiency out of the circuit.

Schematic diagram is added.

Please bear in mind that I am a full time Linux, Java, Python guy who is into C, avr-gcc, Microcontrollers and electronics
just for a hobby.

I think somebody will get some use out of this code. Feedbacks are welcome!

Cheers!
